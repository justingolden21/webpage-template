add postcss-import to package.json and postcss.config.json (allows for @importing other css files in preprocessor) in both tailwind template and tailwind pwa template

update package.json to dev dependencies and add concurrently and local-dev script from my chmod repo

future:
create setup for dynamically generating python scripts (share readme, index, etc among several scripts for easy updates in future)
create template for jekyll tailwind site
more testing on linux
